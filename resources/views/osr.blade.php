		<strong>What we do :-</strong><br>

    It's not that we are out to change the world. But then again... always good to have extra blessings to your aide. A part of our earning from each delivery goes to feed someone who needs it through Akshaya Patra, a well known NGO, working towards providing food to children in primary schools. <br><br>
